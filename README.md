# We Moved!!

**Uni10** official repo now is hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/uni10/uni10/)  
The maintenance for `Uni10 v1.0` has stopped.  
Users are encouraged to checkout the latest version from official repo.

# However...

For those current `pyUni10 v1.0` users  
who are looking for enhancements/patches instead of a paradigm shift,  
this **pyUni10-rev** branch may suit you.

# New Features
 - Better numpy support
 - Serializable objects. Support multiprocessing
 - Fermionic Network contraction
 - Faster Network contraction for tensors without Qnum
